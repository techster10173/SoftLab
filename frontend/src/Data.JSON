        "description": "The research material included in the Abdominal and Direct Fetal Electrocardiogram Database contains multichannel fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) recordings obtained from 5 different women in labor, between 38 and 41 weeks of gestation. The recordings were acquired in the Department of Obstetrics at the Medical University of Silesia, by means of the KOMPOREL system for acquisition and analysis of fetal electrocardiogram (ITAM Institute, Zabrze, Poland). Each recording comprises four differential signals acquired from maternal abdomen and the reference direct fetal electrocardiogram registered from the fetal head.",

        "name": "Behavioral and autonomic dynamics during propofol-induced unconsciousness",
        "description": "During general anesthesia, both behavioral and autonomic changes are caused by the administration of anesthetics such as propofol. Propofol produces unconsciousness by creating highly structured oscillations in brain circuits. The anesthetic also has autonomic effects due to its actions as a vasodilator and myocardial depressant. Understanding how autonomic dynamics change in relation to propofol-induced unconsciousness is an important scientific and clinical question since anesthesiologists often infer changes in level of unconsciousness from changes in autonomic dynamics.",
